## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**B-Paixao/B-Paixao** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”¬ Iâ€™m currently working as a patholosgist in a veterinary laboratory.
- ğŸ–¥ Iâ€™m currently learning about programming.  
- âš™ Iâ€™m looking to improve my programming skills and apply them in my day-to-day work with the vet.
